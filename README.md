# Prework study guide webpage

## Description

This project will help organize a study guide for coding students to make it quick and easy to learn and apply new skills.

This project is being build to help practice and implement the skills we are learning in our prework.

The problem being solved is eliminating the noise of studying by giving a framework to organize notes, in order to study effectively.

I learned basic javascript, and how to create a new project repo. Not to mention learning how to structure this README.md file.
